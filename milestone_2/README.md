Milestone 2
===========

For this milestone, we used Gaussian Processes on two different kernels -- RBF and DP (dot product) and constant kernel -- and examined both regression and classification for each. We tested these regressions on data sets on different sizes -- 1%, 5%, 10%, and 100% of the dataset.
We ran 10-fold cross validation on all of them, using mean-squared error for regressions and accuracy for classifications. Constant kernel gave us the most accurate results.

Difficulties: The DP tests did not finish, as they took too much time. We will look into that issue in the future 

Resources: Python and scikit-learn

To run the code: Self explanatory, run regressions / classifications using Python.
